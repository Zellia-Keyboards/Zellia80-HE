## Overview

The Zellia Hall-Effect Keyboard project is designed to use the **SS39 sensors** and the **STM32FG474 microcontroller** to create a highly responsive, low-latency keyboard.

This PCB design is compatible with the **Unified Daughterboard C5** (available from [KBDFans](https://kbdfans.com/products/tofu60-2-0-accessories?_pos=1&_sid=b8f5e035d&_ss=r&variant=41431070245003)).

## Features

- **Hall-Effect Sensors**: 
  - Uses **SS39** Hall-effect sensors for accurate key detection.
- **Microcontroller**: 
  - Based on the **STM32G474** MCU for high clock performance and fast ADC performance.
- **Multiplexing**: 
  - Integrates **8 multiplexers** (8 total, 2 for each ADC) to handle key matrix and expand ADC channels.
- **Debugging Interface**:
  - **SWDIO/SWCLK** for debugging and firmware updates.
  - **UART RX/TX** for serial communication.
- **RGB**: 
  - **SK6812** leds for customizable RGB effect.
- **Daughterboard Compatibility**: 
  - Compatible with the **Unified Daughterboard C5**.
- **Layout & Compatibility**:
  - Zellia is compatible with any daughterboard powered keyboard as long as you have a proper plate with compatible standoffs and KBDFans M2-3 Countersunk flat head screw kit (Available from [KBDFans](https://kbdfans.com/products/kbdfans-m2-3-countersunk-flat-head-screw-kit)).
(E.G. Tiger 80 Lite)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use this PCB project, you'll need:
